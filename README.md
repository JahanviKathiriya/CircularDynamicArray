# CircularDynamicArray
 A circular dynamic array library

CircularDyanmicArray.cpp was submitted for CS 201 project 1. All the requiremements for the project can be found in CDA_Phase1.pdf to be used as a guide while working with the created library. This code has been optimized for best runtime results!

A makefile is attached along with a sample main file (see Phase1Main.cpp)

This works perfectly, got a 100!

Enjoy :)
